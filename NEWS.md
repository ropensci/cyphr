# cyphr 1.0.6

* Added wrappers for `readxl::read_excel` and `writexl::write_xlsx` (reside-109)
* Support for custom messages during requesting and authorising access to data (reside-108)

# cyphr 1.0.1

* First CRAN release

# cyphr 0.2.0

* Authenticated encryption (with signed messages) is now supported for openssl, and is enabled by default.  Along with this the pack format for openssl has changed which will break *all* existing uses of the package (I don't believe there are any)

* Initial prototype, as sent to rOpenSci onboarding for review
